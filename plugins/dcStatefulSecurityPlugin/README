# dcStatefulSecurity plugin

The `dcStatefulSecurityPlugin` is a symfony plugin that provides authorization
features above the standard security feature of symfony.

## Installation

  * Install the plugin

    * using the symfony plugin system

            [bash]
            $ symfony plugin:install dcStatefulSecurityPlugin

    * using subversion

            [bash]
            $ svn co http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/dcStatefulSecurityPlugin/trunk dcStatefulSecurityPlugin

  * Insert the filter

        [yaml]
        rendering: ~
        security:  ~

        # insert your own filters here
        stateful_security:
          class: dcStatefulSecurityFilter

        cache:     ~
        execution: ~

    Optionally, you can set the default policy:

        [yaml]
        stateful_security:
          class: dcStatefulSecurityFilter
          param:
            default_policy: allow # or deny

    Default policy gives you the posibility of allow or deny actions that are not defined in the user class.

  * Clear you cache

        [bash]
        $ symfony cc

## Usage

Define the user permissions based on object states (and user credentials, why not?).

For example, supose that we have the person module, so, we can disallow the user to edit persons that
are blocked (supose that a person is blocked if an attribute 'is_blocked' is set to true)

    [php]
    // in myUser.class.php
    public function canEditPerson($person)
    {
      return !$person->isBlocked();
    }
