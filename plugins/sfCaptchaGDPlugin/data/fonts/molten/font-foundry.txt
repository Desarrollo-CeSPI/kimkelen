Copyright Considerations
------------------------

Please consult the readme file in the font package to make sure 
you comply with any specific license terms the author requests.
Note that though this material may have been in a public depository, 
certain author copyright restrictions may apply.

Before installing any typefaces we ask you to respect the shareware 
concept and support the authors by paying for the typefaces. Many 
authors only request a few dollars for their work, this isn't much 
to ask in exchange for hours of a designers' time.

" No other design discipline requires so much 
  learning and training as typography, and by 
  no other aspect can amateurs be so easily 
  distinguished from professionals. To be font 
  literate, a designer has to study the history 
  and the principles of font design. "
