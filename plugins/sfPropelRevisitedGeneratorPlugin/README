# Improvements over sfPropelAdminGenerator

## Conditional actions

By adding a 'condition: myMethod' attribute on action keys underneath 'object_actions' and/or
'actions' (in 'new', 'edit' or 'show' sections) the action will only be displayed for any object
if $object->myMethod() returns true.

By adding a 'condition: myUserMethod' attribute on action keys underneath 'actions' in 'list' section
the action will only be displayed if <?php sfContext::getInstance()->getUser()->myUserMethod() ?> evaluates
to true.

## Collapsed filters

Filters form will be collapsed by default, unless filters are applied, in which case
it will be shown to let the user quickly know he or she has applied filters to the list.

## Required fields distinction

Every form field whose validator has a 'required' option set to true will be given a special
CSS class: 'required', which will be assigned both to the label and to the widget.
